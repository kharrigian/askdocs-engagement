# Quantifying Factors of Engagement with Posts in Online Health Communities

## Requirements

Code is developed for Python 3.7.10, Anaconda distribution. All package requirements are enumerated in requirements.txt.

## Data

We use the `retriever` python package to query all comments and submissions made in the r/AskDocs subreddit between January 2008 and April 2021. The data query procedure began on April 4, 2021 and ended on April 6, 2021. Comments before January 2017 have been archived and are no longer easily available via the API. We only consider submissions posted up to January 2021.
